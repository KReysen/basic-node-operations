1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they 
work and what the output was.

Sort - sorts each line alphabetically and shows them in order (but space and slash come before 
the letters alphabetically, so the first line shown is the one with the most spaces

 done(data);
      if (err) throw err;
    // echo functionality
    break;
    break;
    case "cat":
    case "echo":
    commandLibrary.cat(userInputArray.slice(1));
    commandLibrary.echo(userInputArray.slice(1).join(" "));
    const fileName = fullPath[0];
    done(userInput);
    fs.readFile(fileName, (err, data) => {
    process.stdout.write('\nprompt > ');
    process.stdout.write(output);
    });
  "cat": function(fullPath) {
  "echo": function(userInput) {
  //the echo command
  const command = userInputArray[0];
  const userInputArray = userInput.split(" ");
  switch(command) {
  }
  }
  },
 //parses the user input to understand which command was typed
//where we will store our commands
//where we will store the logic of our commands
//write out data
const commandLibrary = {
const fs = require("fs");
function done(output) {
function evaluateCmd(userInput) {
module.exports.commandLibrary = commandLibrary;
module.exports.evaluateCmd = evaluateCmd;
}
}
};


wc -  output ` 42  106 1031 commands.js` the line count, word count and byte count

uniq - shows every unique line, which in this case is just the whole file contents
because we don't have repeated statements in this so far

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. 
Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

ran uniq commands.js | wc  
the output was 42 106 1031   because we sorted the original for duplicate lines, but there were
none, so we ended up with the same counts as we got earlier for the original file. It didn't
include the commands.js as the end as we got with just the wc command, because we weren't running
wc on the file commands.js, we were running it on the sorted version of the file from the previous command

var inputString = "I'm learning to program algorithms!";

function reverseString(inputString){
  // split into an array of each character
var splitInput = inputString.split("");
// reverse the order of all the characters
splitInput.reverse();
// join characters back into string of reversed words, reversed order
let backWords = splitInput.join("");
// split into an array of reversed words, reversed order
let backArray = backWords.split(" ");
// put each word into an array in the correct order
let finalArray = [];
  backArray.forEach((element) => {
   finalArray.unshift(element);
  });
  // join back into a string
  var reversedString = finalArray.join(" ");
  return reversedString;
}
// test
console.log(reverseString(inputString));

// returns 'm'I gninrael ot margorp !smhtirogla'
